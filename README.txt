Energy Analytics Forecasting Assignment: 2020

Each group is required to make 8 separate forecasts for total electricity demand for England and Wales on the following day.  
Forecasts will be required on Monday, Wednesday and Friday of week 3 and week 4, together with Monday and Wednesday of week 5. 
In each round you must provide a forecast of the total electricity demand for the following day and also a measure of the error in your forecast. 
Specifically you should give your estimate of the mean of the log (to base e) of the following day’s demand, and the standard deviation for this number.

The forecast will be scored against actual demand. The evaluation will use a KLIC based approach, where the mean and standard deviation you provide serve 
to define a normal distribution for the value of log load. The winning team will get a (token) prize, but placement in the competition will not form part 
of the assessment. The forecasts must be based on the information provided (see the description below for more information on this). You can use information
from the date, the previous load figures, the previous weather information and the weather forecast for the following day. You need to explain exactly how
you reached the forecast you make.  As the competition proceeds it is likely that you will refine your method. If you cannot explain how you reached your
forecast, then you will lose marks (so you are not allowed to ‘’guess’’, or to use a forecast gleaned from somewhere else.)

For each round new data will be loaded up between 11 am and 1 pm. The forecast for the following day’s total demand must be provided by 5 pm. 
If a team fails to meet the deadline in round 1, a forecast using the mean and standard deviation of the 2019 demand data will be used instead. 
After round 1 if the deadline is not met the team’s previous forecast (for a different day) will be used instead.

There are 8 rounds (forecasts for Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday in weeks 3 and 4, and Tuesday and Thursday in week 5). The report is due to be handed in at 
4 pm on Tuesday 24 March. There is a page limit of 12 pages (including figures and tables). The report should cover: 

(a) (80%) The forecasting method recommended, with a discussion of the reasons for making this recommendation.  This should include an explanation of exactly 
how the different forecasts made during the competition were arrived at – and the reasons for any adjustments in forecasting method made during the competition. 

(b) (20%) An assessment of the accuracy of this forecasting method; 

You do not need to include your code in the report, but you should give a clear description of the method used for any calculations. You will be assessed on 
the quality of your writing, and in particular you will lose marks if anything is unclear. The report does not need to have an executive summary.  

The data provided

There are three components to the spreadsheet:  

First it contains a history of weather information from the start of 2017.  This is taken from the Hadley Centre Central England Temperature (HadCET) dataset 
(www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadcet/) . These data are calculated for a roughly triangular area of the UK enclosed by Lancashire, London and Bristol. There are 
minimum, mean and maximum temperatures given.  These are updated daily but subject to minor revisions at the end of the month. 

Second it contains the total electricity load for England and Wales which is published on a daily basis, by National Grid 

Third it contains day ahead forecasts. These are in the form of minimum, mean, and maximum figures for three cities: London, Bristol and Leeds. These are given 
for the last couple of weeks so that you can check how they compare with HadCET data. 

The version currently published has a final line of data entered on Thursday 27 February. This has the HadCET weather data up to Wednesday 26 February, the 
National Grid load data up to Wednesday 26 February and the weather forecasts for the three cities for Friday 28 February. 

A new version of the spreadsheet will be published on the day that a forecast is due (so the first of these updates will be on Monday 2 March)
